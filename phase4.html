        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>In this project, I was mainly responsible for programming movement and all things required for the game loop. I designed the 'capture the objectives' gamemode, programmed respawning and spectaing, and all movement related abilites. I also was responsible for programming environmental interactions, such as our gas geysers and electric fences.</p>
        <p>I also contributed to this game's netcode, combat system, and particle effects.</p>
