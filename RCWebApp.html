        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This web application was designed to give those in the rock climbing community a space to share thoughts, post sends, and react to others. Few places currently exist for this particular community, and it is something I am increasingly passionate about.</p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>In this project, I was the sole contributor. I programmed both back-end and front-end functionality to get this site working. I also implemented a basic relational database using SQL to store information such as posts, user IDs, etc.</p>
        <p>Currently, this site is still a work in progress and is not yet published. More information can be found on GitHub.</p>
